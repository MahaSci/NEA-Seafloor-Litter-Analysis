- 11.2 Evaluate the learning process and how the project has prepared the student for continuous learning and adaptation in the field:
Within the README, reflect on your progress, the challenges you've faced, and the strategies used to overcome these challenges. This shows a continuous learning mindset. Within your README, include a development roadmap that details what new skills or tools you plan to learn next based on your project experience. In your bug section of the README, mention how you adapted the code to overcome challenges. This can include identifying specific moments where you recognised gaps in your knowledge and how you addressed them. If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.
