# Ethical Considerations in the Project

## Ethical Considerations
The project prioritised ethical practices by ensuring transparency in both data sources and analytical methods. This was achieved by clearly documenting the origin of the data (publicly available data from CEFAS) and the methodologies used to process and analyse it. By adhering to ethical principles, such as transparency and integrity, the project ensured that stakeholders could trust the data and its interpretation.

## Data Privacy
As the data utilised pertains to marine litter and is publicly available, it does not contain any personally identifiable information. Consequently, data privacy concerns, such as those related to the GDPR, are not applicable to this project. By using non-sensitive public data, we ensured that no individualâ€™s personal data was at risk of being compromised.

## Bias and Fairness
Potential biases were carefully addressed through a review of the dataset and the analysis processes. I made sure to cross-checked results and insights against the original dataset to ensure accuracy, fairness, and to prevent any unintended distortion of the data. This step was vital in maintaining the integrity of the findings.

## Transparency
The project maintained transparency by clearly outlining the use of AI tools, specifying the prompts employed to generate AI responses. This openness allowed for an understanding of how AI contributed to the analysis and reassured stakeholders about the credibility and reliability of the findings.

## Legal & Social Implications
The project adhered to the usage guidelines provided by CEFAS, the data custodian, ensuring full compliance with relevant data handling regulations. Since the data used in the project is public, there were no concerns about compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR. The project operated within the legal framework established for the use of publicly available marine data.

The findings of the project have the potential to raise awareness about the growing issue of marine litter, an important environmental concern. By sharing these findings, the project may influence public policy, promote industry practices aimed at reducing marine pollution, and encourage community action to address the issue. 

Additionally, the visualisation tools developed as part of the project can help various individuals, be it the environmental agency, the public, or policymakers, to help better undestand the problem of marine litter, and next steps to help mitigate this problem

## Reflection
Throughout the project, ethical considerations were integrated by ensuring transparency in data handling and adhering to principles of fairness and accuracy. The primary challenge was managing the responsible use of AI in data analysis, which was addressed by carefully reviewing and validating AI-generated results against the original data.
