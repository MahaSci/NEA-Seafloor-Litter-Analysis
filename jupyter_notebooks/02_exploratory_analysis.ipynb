    "\n",
    "Summary statistics summarise the mean, median, mode, standard deviation and min/max values in one statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `MEAN:` The mean is a statistical tool used to find the average of a set of given numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To calculate it, sum all of the values in the dataset and divide that sum by the count. We can use np.mean() to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sum: Total amount of the addition of all datapoints in the given numerical column.\n",
    "    - Count: Total number of all datapoints in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important foundational principle for data analysis because it provides a measure of central tendency which represents the typical value in a given data column. This allows us to compare averages across different datasets or subgroups within a given dataset. The mean can also be used to examine the change in mean over an extended period of time to view shifts and trends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is important to note, however, that the mean is sensitive to extreme outliers. In datasets that have highly skewed distribution, the mean may not accurately represent a typical datapoint. Hence, we must investigate the data in conjunctions with other statistical measures.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. `MEDIAN:` The median is a statistical tool used to find the middle value of an ordered set of given numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To calculate it, you first need to order the datapoints in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If you have an odd number of values, the median is simply the middle number.\n",
    "    - If you have an even number of values, the median is the averaege of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can use np.median() to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important foundational principle for data analysis because it helps to identify a typical value of the dataset - 50% of the data is above this point and 50% of the data is below this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by extreme outliers, therefore it is a better measure of central tendency for a dataset with a skewed distribution. If the mean and median values are closely aligned, the data is likely symmetrical with a normal distribution, else, if they are not aligned, the data is likely skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `MODE:` The mode is a statistical tool used to find the most frequent value in the given datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To calculate it, simply count the number of times each value appears in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use scipy.stats.mode() to do so on a numpy array.\n",

    "- Large standard deviation: The datappoints are far from the average.\n",

    "5. `HYPOTHESIS TESTING:` Hypothesis testing is a statistical concept used to check if our guesses about the data are likely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It involves setting up a \"null hypothesis\" (a statement we want to test) and then using statistical tests to see if the data provides enough evidence to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important foundational principle for data analysis because it allows us to check if observerd patterns are either likely to be due to chance or if they are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "6. `BASIC PROBABILITY:` Probability is a statistical concept used to understand how likely it is that something will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (or as a percentage). 0 means it's impossible, and 1 (or 100%) means it's certain.\n",

    "This is an important foundational principle for data analysis because it helps us understand the changes of different outcomes. For example, if we want to know the probability of finding a certain type of litter in a specifc area, based on the historical information, we can use probability to understand how likely that is.\n"

    "* **Cruise:** The 'CEND 4/15' cruise shows the highest frequency, suggesting a focused period of data collection. The variety of cruise names indicates multiple data collection expeditions.\n",
