    "   **Year Distribution**\n",
    "  - The data spans several years, with 2011 having the highest count (640) and 2002 the lowest (22).\n",
    "  - The year range covers both recent and older periods, with a noticeable decrease in data points as you go further back in time.\n",
    "  - The years 2011, 2010, and 2014 dominate, indicating that more data was collected in those years.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Survey Distribution**\n",
    "  - **IBTS** survey has the highest count (1575), significantly outpacing all other surveys.\n",
    "  - The next largest survey is **NWGFS** (566), followed by **Q1SW_with Blinder** (496), suggesting these surveys might be more extensive or more frequently conducted.\n",
    "  - Other surveys, such as **MEMFISH** (95) and **Q1SW** (138), have significantly lower counts, indicating they might be more specialised or less frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Cruise Distribution**\n",
    "  - **CEND 4/15** has the highest cruise count (277), followed by other CEND series cruises (e.g., **Cend04/14**, **Cend5/11**), which seem to be relatively frequent (counts between 90 and 200).\n",
    "  - Several cruises with **CIRO** prefixes (e.g., **CIRO 6/00**, **CIRO 11/94**) have counts of 75, indicating they were conducted on a few key occasions.\n",
    "  - Some cruises like **CSEMP2008** (37) and **CSEMP2007** (31) show smaller numbers, likely due to being more specific or infrequent surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Area Distribution**\n",
    "  - Two main areas: **Greater North Sea** (2241) and **Celtic Seas** (1792).\n",

    "  \n",
    "  **Station Distribution**\n",
    "  - Station values are widely distributed:\n",
    "    - **Station 0** has the highest count (1031), indicating it's a primary or central location.\n",
    "    - Other stations have significantly lower counts, with some stations (like 290, 142, 292) having only 1 count, suggesting they represent rare or specific locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Observations**\n",
    "From the analysis, it's clear that the data collection has been much more concentrated in recent years, particularly around 2010-2014. The dominance of the **IBTS** survey suggests it's the primary source of the data, with a smaller set of other surveys contributing. The variety in the number of cruises and the regions surveyed shows that the data may come from both regular, extensive surveys (Greater North Sea) and more targeted studies in specific areas. It also seems that Station 0 is the central location for data collection, while others are used sparingly or for more niche observations. \n"
